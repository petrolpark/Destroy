40.0
====
 - 40.0.54 Add event for hooking into StructuresBecomeConfiguredFix Fixes #8505
           Pass-through unknown structure IDs with "unknown." prefix
           This avoids the fixer throwing an exception due to the unknown
           structure, which causes the chunk data to be dropped (and freshly
           regenerated later). The deserializer logs and ignores the unknown
           structure ID, avoiding full chunk data loss.
 - 40.0.53 Fix missed patch for loading modded dimensions on Dedicated Server start  (#8555)
 - 40.0.52 Fix potential concurrency issues with BiomeDictionary. Closes #8266
 - 40.0.51 Fix debug text being rendered slightly wrong.
 - 40.0.50 Fix intrusive handlers on dummy objects.
 - 40.0.49 Amend license header to include contributors and apply to FML subprojects (#8525)
           After internal discussion, it was decided that we need to include
           "contributors" to the license header. This avoids claiming that the
           Java source files are under the exclusive copyright ownership of Forge
           LLC, which excludes contributors that still hold copyright ownership
           over their contributions (but is licensed under the LGPLv2.1 as stated
           in the Forge CLA).
 - 40.0.48 Add modern implementation of the Slider widget and deprecate the old one (#8496)
 - 40.0.47 Implement ItemStack and LivingEntity sensitive method to get the FoodProperties for an Item (#8477)
 - 40.0.46 Add use context and simulate flag to getToolModifiedState, enabled HOE_TILL action. (#8557)
 - 40.0.45 Remove bad patch for AbstractFurnaceBlockEntity (#8561)
           The patch prevented the entity from being marked as changed when an
           item finished smelting.
 - 40.0.44 Fix issues with custom forge ingredients causing sub ingredients to be prematurely and invalidly cached (#8550)
           Add config option and skip checking for empty ingredients in shapeless recipe deserialization
 - 40.0.43 Add EnderManAngerEvent to make it possible to prevent endermen getting angry at a player based on more then their helmet. (#8406)
 - 40.0.42 Fix misaligned patch in BlockEntity.save.
 - 40.0.41 Expose `getHolder()` method on RegistryObject, as helper for when absolutely necessary to pass  into Vanilla code. (#8548)
           It is recommended you avoid if you can.
 - 40.0.40 Fix return value of Recipe#isIncomplete being inaccurate for empty tags (#8549)
 - 40.0.39 Simplfy default behavior of isSimple (#8543)
           isSimple should only return true if the ingredient is any more sensitive then JUST itemA == itemB
           It used to take metadata and damage into account, but that was removed in the flattening.
           Also prevents fetching tag values too early, as tags are not ready during the ingredient constructor
 - 40.0.38 Implement IPlantable in BambooBlock (#8508)
 - 40.0.37 Fix compiler error in eclipse, bump MCPConfig for FF/Record fix.
 - 40.0.36 Fix TagEmptyCondition by passing tag context into conditional and recipe deserializers. (#8546)

 - 40.0.26 Add some helper Access Transformers (#8490)
 - 40.0.25 Fix incorrect method used in getStream (#8532)
           The original correct method is getPath, but the patch uses getLocation.
           The former is the actual resource path to the sound OGG file, while the
           latter is the sound's location.
           Fixes #8531
 - 40.0.24 [1.18] Make it easier to register custom skull blocks models (#8351)

 - 40.0.19 Fix NPE caused by canceling onServerChatEvent (#8516)
 - 40.0.18 [1.18.2] Fix tags for custom forge registries. (#8495)
           Tag-enabled registries must now be registered to vanilla's root registry. See RegistryBuilder#hasTags.
           Modded tag-enabled registries have to use the format `data/<namespace>/tags/<registrynamespace>/<registryname>/<tag>.json`
           This format is to prevent conflicts for registries with the same path but different namespaces
           EX: Registry name `examplemod:shoe`, tag name `blue_shoes` would be `data/<namespace>/tags/examplemod/shoe/blue_shoes.json`
           RegistryEvent.NewRegistry has been moved and renamed to NewRegistryEvent.
           RegistryBuilder#create has been made private. See NewRegistryEvent#create
           Created new ITagManager system for looking up Forge tags. See IForgeRegistry#tags.
           Add lookup methods for Holders from forge registries. See IForgeRegistry#getHolder.

 - 40.0.16 Fix MC-176559 related to the Mending enchantment (#7606)
 - 40.0.15 [1.18.x] Allow blocks to hide faces on a neighboring block (#8300)

 - 40.0.10 Use wither as griefing entity when it indirectly hurts an entity (#8431)
 - 40.0.9  Provide access to the haveTime supplier in WorldTickEvent and ServerTickEvent (#8470)
 - 40.0.8  Fix durability bar not respecting an item's custom max damage (#8482)
 - 40.0.7  Add event for controlling potion indicators size (#8483)
           This event allows forcing the rendering of the potion indicators in the
           inventory screen to either compact mode (icons only) or classic mode
           (full width with potion effect name).
 - 40.0.6  Introduce system mods to mod loading (#8238)
           Core game mods are mods which are required to exist in the environment
           during mod loading. These may be specially provided mods (for example,
           the `minecraft` mod), or mods which are vital to the framework which
           FML is connected to (for example, Forge and the `forge` mod).
           These core game mods are used as the only existing mods in the mod list
           if mod sorting or dependency verification fails. This allows later
           steps in the which use resources from these mod files to work correctly
           (up to when the error screen is shown and the game exits).
 - 40.0.5  Add missing module exports arg to server arguments list (#8500)
 - 40.0.4  Fixed swim speed attribute (#8499)
 - 40.0.3  Fix incorrect movement distance calculation (#8497)

           Fix TagBasedToolTypesTest not generating needed data correctly.
 - 40.0.1  Fix JNA not working at runtime and causing issues with natives.
 - 40.0.0  Update to 1.18.2

 - 39.0.53 Add ShieldBlockEvent (#8261)
 - 39.0.52 Add renderable API to allow easier rendering of OBJ and other custom models, from Entity and BlockEntity renderers. (#8259)
           This is a redesign of a discarded section of my initial model system rewrite, back in 1.14.
           In order to use it with the OBJ loader, you can use OBJLoader.INSTANCE.loadModel to get the OBJModel, and then call OBJModel#bakeRenderable() to get a SimpleRenderable object to render with.
           The SimpleRenderable support animation, by providing different transformation matrices for each part in the MultipartTransforms.
           Additionally, a BakedRenderable helper exists to turn an arbitrary BakedModel into a renderable.
           After trying to get the B3D loader to work, I decided it wasn't worth the trouble and marked it for removal instead.
