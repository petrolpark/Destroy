     * which exists in Destroy's codebase which could do that. Nothing. It's all final fields. Yet somehow it happens. But you know when it
     * doesn't happen? For some fucking reason, this doesn't happen if you inspect the reactant before its reacted. Add a breakpoint, print
     * the structure, any of those are fine. It is only if you force the program to stop and look at what its doing that it realises it's
     * being fucking stupid. Or maybe I am. Maybe I just don't realize what's causing this. Maybe I got up in the middle of the night and
     * added multithreading to reaction generation and then forgot about it and now I can't find where I added it again. These are all
     * possibilities. I don't know. The only fucking thing I know is that printing the structure of the reactant fixes it. Fuck you.
